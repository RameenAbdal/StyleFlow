**Figure:** *Sequential edits using StyleFlow*

High-quality, diverse, and photorealistic images can now be generated by unconditional GANs (e.g., StyleGAN). However, limited options exist to control the generation process using (semantic) attributes, while still preserving the quality of the output. Further, due to the entangled nature of the GAN latent space, performing edits along one attribute can easily result in unwanted changes along other attributes. In this paper, in the context of conditional exploration of entangled latent spaces, we investigate the two sub-problems of attribute-conditioned sampling and attribute-controlled editing. We present StyleFlow as a simple, effective, and robust solution to both the sub-problems by formulating conditional exploration as an instance of conditional continuous normalizing flows in the GAN latent space conditioned by attribute features. We evaluate our method using the face and the car latent space of StyleGAN, and demonstrate fine-grained disentangled edits along various attributes on both real photographs and StyleGAN generated images. For example, for faces, we vary camera pose, illumination variation, expression, facial hair, gender, and age. Finally, via extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons, we demonstrate the superiority of StyleFlow to other concurrent works.

## Installation

Clone this repo.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RameenAbdal/StyleFlow.git
cd StyleFlow/
```

StyleGAN2 relies on custom TensorFlow ops that are compiled on the fly using [NVCC](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/index.html). To correctly setup the StyleGAN2 generator follow the **Requirements** in [this repo](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2).
```bash
# This packages are enough to fulfill all requirements (at least for WSL Ubuntu>=20.04 installation)
sudo apt install cmake g++ gnupg nvidia-cuda-toolkit
```

This code requires PyTorch, TensorFlow, Torchdiffeq, Python 3+ and Pyqt5. Please install dependencies by
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Installation (Docker)

Clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RameenAbdal/StyleFlow.git
cd StyleFlow/
```

You must have CUDA >=10.0 and [nvidia-docker2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) installed first !

Then, run :

```bash
xhost +local:docker # Letting Docker access X server
wget -P stylegan/ http://d36zk2xti64re0.cloudfront.net/stylegan2/networks/stylegan2-ffhq-config-f.pkl
docker-compose up --build # Expect some time before UI appears
```

When finished, run :

```bash
xhost -local:docker
```

## UI Illustration

**Loading images may take 2 - 3 seconds on the first click. Move the slider smoothly to render results.**




## Editing Images Using Pretrained Models


1.  Run the main UI

    ``` bash
	python main.py
    ```

2. Run the Attribute Transfer UI
	```bash
   python main_attribute.py
    ```

## Web UI (Beta)
A web based UI is also now available. Follow [webui](https://github.com/RameenAbdal/StyleFlow/tree/webui) dev branch for setup.

## Broader Impact
*Important* : Deep learning based facial imagery like DeepFakes and GAN generated images can be gravely misused. This can spread misinformation and lead to other offences. The intent of our work is not to promote such practices but instead be used in the areas such as identification (novel views of a subject, occlusion inpainting etc. ), security (facial composites etc.), image compression (high quality video conferencing at lower bitrates etc.) and development of algorithms for detecting DeepFakes.
